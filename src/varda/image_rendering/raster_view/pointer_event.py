"""Backend-neutral input events delivered to viewport tools.

Tools used to receive raw `QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent`s and map coordinates
themselves (`imageItem.mapFromScene`, then `localToImage`). That tied every tool
to the pyqtgraph scene graph. Instead, the viewport now translates its backend's
native events into these plain dataclasses — coordinates are pre-mapped once, in
the viewport (the only place that knows the backend) — and hands them to tools.

Coordinates come in two frames so tools don't have to map anything:
  - `localPos`: viewport-local (data) coordinates — for positioning overlays.
  - `imagePos`: full-image pixel coordinates — for geometry / pixel readout.
For a viewport showing the whole image these coincide; for a viewport showing an
inner region they differ (that is exactly what `localToImage` accounts for).
