"""Renderer-agnostic contract for a raster viewport.

`RasterViewport` is the seam between the rest of Varda and whatever graphics
backend draws the image. Today the only implementation is the pyqtgraph-based
`ImageViewport`; the point of pinning the contract down now is that controllers
and tools can depend on *this* Protocol instead of reaching into pyqtgraph
internals, so a future VisPy/pygfx viewport becomes "implement one Protocol"
rather than "rewrite every consumer".

Backend-neutral overlays go through the `add*Overlay` factories (`addCrosshair`,
`addPolygonOverlay`, `addTextOverlay`), which return abstract handles — tools use
these instead of constructing pyqtgraph items. Tool input arrives as
backend-neutral `PointerEvent`/`KeyEvent`s (see `pointer_event`), so tools never
touch the scene graph.

Provisional surface that still traffics in raw pyqtgraph objects (typed loosely
as `object` to keep pyqtgraph out of the contract): `addItem`/`removeItem` (used
for ROI-display graphics items) and `showRegion`. A later step replaces these
with a backend-neutral ROI-overlay mechanism.
